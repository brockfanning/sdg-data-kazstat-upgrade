indicator: 3.2.1
indicator_definition: The probability of a child born in a specific year or period
  dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates
  of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under-five mortality rate as
  defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided
  by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability
  of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births.
